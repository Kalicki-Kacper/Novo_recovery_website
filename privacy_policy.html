            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 29, 2025</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Your Privacy is Our Priority</strong></p>
                <p>Novo Recovery is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your personal health and recovery data should remain exactly that - personal. All your data stays on your device, and we have no access to it.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>1. Overview</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Novo Recovery ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Novo Recovery is built on a privacy-first principle: <strong>your personal health and recovery data never leaves your device.</strong></p>

            <p>We only collect minimal, anonymous usage analytics through Apple's App Store Connect to help us understand how the app is performing and improve it over time.</p>

            <p>By using Novo Recovery, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>

            <h4>2.1 Personal Data We Do NOT Collect</h4>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>We want to be absolutely clear about what we don't collect:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personally identifying information</li>
                    <li><strong>No Health Data:</strong> Your recovery metrics, activity logs, sleep data, mood tracking, journal entries, and all wellness information remain exclusively on your device and are never transmitted to us</li>
                    <li><strong>No Device Identifiers:</strong> We do not collect device-specific identifiers that could identify you personally</li>
                    <li><strong>No Location Data:</strong> We do not collect or track your location in any way</li>
                    <li><strong>No Account Data:</strong> There are no accounts, logins, or cloud storage - everything is local</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>2.2 Anonymous Usage Analytics</h4>
            <p>Through Apple's App Store Connect, we collect anonymous, aggregated analytics data to understand how the app is being used and to improve its performance. This data is collected automatically by Apple and includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>App Performance Metrics:</strong> Crash reports, app launch times, battery usage, and performance data</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> Number of app sessions, session duration, and which features are used (in aggregate)</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, iOS version, app version, and region/country (anonymized and aggregated)</li>
                <li><strong>Installation Data:</strong> Number of downloads, updates, and deletions (aggregated)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important Notes About This Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This data is collected and anonymized by Apple, not by us directly</li>
                <li>The data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individual users</li>
                <li>We receive this data in aggregate form through Apple's App Store Connect dashboard</li>
                <li>This data does not include any of your personal health information or content you enter into the app</li>
                <li>You can opt out of sharing analytics with app developers through your iPhone Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Share iPhone Analytics (disable this option)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How We Use Analytics Data</h3>
            <p>We use the anonymous, aggregated analytics data from Apple to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify and fix crashes and technical issues</li>
                <li>Understand which features are most popular to guide future development</li>
                <li>Monitor app performance and optimize speed and battery usage</li>
                <li>Understand general usage patterns to improve user experience</li>
                <li>Make data-driven decisions about new features and improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>We do not use this data to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track individual users</li>
                <li>Serve advertisements</li>
                <li>Sell or share with third parties (beyond Apple providing us the aggregated data)</li>
                <li>Create user profiles</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. How Your Personal Data is Stored</h3>
            <p><strong>Local Device Storage Only:</strong></p>
            <p>All personal data you enter into Novo Recovery is stored exclusively on your device using secure local storage. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recovery tracking and progress data</li>
                <li>Personal notes and journal entries</li>
                <li>Goals and milestones</li>
                <li>Custom settings and preferences</li>
                <li>Any other information you choose to track</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal data never leaves your device</li>
                <li>No servers process or store your personal information</li>
                <li>We cannot access, view, or recover your personal data</li>
                <li>Your data is protected by your device's security features (passcode, biometric authentication, encryption)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Data Deletion</h3>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Important: Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all your personal data.</strong></p>
                <p>Because all personal data is stored locally on your device, when you uninstall Novo Recovery, all your information will be permanently deleted. This data cannot be recovered by us or by you.</p>
                <p><strong>Before uninstalling:</strong> If you want to keep your data, we recommend taking screenshots or manually backing up any important information you wish to preserve.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>6. No Data Backup or Sync</h3>
            <p>Novo Recovery does not provide cloud backup or sync features. This is by design to protect your privacy. Your personal data exists only on the device where you've installed the app.</p>
            <p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you lose your device, your data cannot be recovered</li>
                <li>If you switch to a new device, your data will not transfer automatically</li>
                <li>If you uninstall the app, your data is permanently deleted</li>
                <li>Device backups (such as iCloud or iTunes backups) may include app data based on your device settings - this is controlled by Apple and your device settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
            
            <h4>7.1 Apple App Store and App Store Connect</h4>
            <p>When you download Novo Recovery from the Apple App Store, Apple collects certain information as part of the download and purchase process. Additionally, Apple provides us with anonymous, aggregated analytics through App Store Connect as described in Section 2.2.</p>
            
            <p>Apple's collection and use of this data is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy, which can be found at: <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a></p>

            <h4>7.2 In-App Purchases</h4>
            <p>If you make in-app purchases (such as upgrading to the lifetime version), these transactions are processed by Apple through their payment system. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple's privacy policy governs how your purchase information is handled.</p>

            <p><strong>Note about pricing:</strong> Prices for in-app purchases, including the lifetime subscription, are subject to change at any time. Price increases may occur without prior notice. Current pricing is always displayed in the App Store before purchase.</p>

            <h4>7.3 No Other Third Parties</h4>
            <p>Beyond Apple's App Store Connect analytics, we do not integrate with any other analytics services, advertising networks, or third-party services that would collect your data.</p>

            <h3>8. Device Permissions</h3>
            <p>Novo Recovery may request certain permissions to provide functionality. However, all data accessed through these permissions remains on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you reminders and motivational messages (locally generated on your device, not from our servers)</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> To save your personal data securely on your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We only request permissions that are necessary for core app functionality. You can manage these permissions through your device settings at any time.</p>

            <h3>9. Opting Out of Analytics</h3>
            <p>You have control over whether anonymous usage analytics are shared with app developers:</p>
            
            <p><strong>To opt out of sharing analytics data:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad</li>
                <li>Go to Privacy & Security</li>
                <li>Tap on Analytics & Improvements</li>
                <li>Toggle off "Share iPhone Analytics" (or "Share iPad Analytics")</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This will prevent Apple from sharing anonymous usage data with us and all other app developers. Please note that disabling this setting affects all apps on your device, not just Novo Recovery.</p>

            <h3>10. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Novo Recovery does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 18. Since no personal data is transmitted to our servers and only anonymous, aggregated analytics are collected through Apple, we have no way of knowing the age of our users.</p>
            
            <p>Parents and guardians should be aware that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All personal data entered by children will be stored locally on the device</li>
                <li>Anonymous usage analytics may be collected through Apple's App Store Connect if device analytics sharing is enabled</li>
                <li>Parents can disable analytics sharing through device settings (see Section 9)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>11. Security</h3>
            <p>Because your personal data never leaves your device, the security of your information depends primarily on your device's security features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Use a strong passcode, PIN, or biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID) on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Keep iOS Updated:</strong> Ensure your device's operating system is up to date to benefit from the latest security patches</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Keep your device secure and don't share it with untrusted individuals</li>
                <li><strong>App Permissions:</strong> Review and manage app permissions in your device settings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On our end, we've designed the app to use iOS secure storage mechanisms to protect your personal data at rest on your device.</p>

            <h3>12. Your Rights and Control</h3>
            <p>Since we don't collect or store your personal data on our servers, you have complete control over it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Control:</strong> You can view, edit, or delete any personal data within the app at any time</li>
                <li><strong>No Data Requests Needed:</strong> You don't need to request access to your data - you already have it on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Deletion:</strong> Delete individual entries or all personal data directly within the app</li>
                <li><strong>No Data Portability Issues:</strong> Your personal data is already on your device; there's nothing to export from our servers</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> Control whether anonymous analytics are shared through your device settings (see Section 9)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>13. International Users</h3>
            <p>Because we don't collect or transfer personal data to our servers, international data transfer regulations (such as GDPR requirements for data transfers outside the EU) do not apply to your personal health information. Your personal data stays on your device regardless of where you are located.</p>
            
            <p>Anonymous, aggregated analytics data is collected by Apple through App Store Connect and is subject to Apple's privacy practices and international data transfer mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>14. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h3>
            <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have certain rights regarding their personal information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>For Personal Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not collect, sell, or share personal information</li>
                <li>We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising</li>
                <li>All personal data stays on your device</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>For Anonymous Analytics Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous, aggregated usage analytics are collected through Apple's App Store Connect</li>
                <li>This data cannot be used to identify individual users</li>
                <li>This data is not sold or shared with third parties beyond Apple providing it to us</li>
                <li>You can opt out through your device settings (see Section 9)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>15. GDPR Compliance (European Users)</h3>
            <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland:</p>

            <p><strong>For Personal Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not process personal data on our servers</li>

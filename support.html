            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How do I get started with Novo Recovery?</h4>
                <p>Getting started is easy! Download the app from the App Store, launch it, and follow the onboarding process. You'll be guided through setting up your recovery tracking preferences and customizing the app to fit your needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is my data secure and private?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely! Your privacy is our top priority. All your personal data is stored exclusively on your device and never leaves it. We don't have access to your recovery data, journal entries, or any personal information you track. For more details, please see our <a href="privacy.html" style="color: #667eea;">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Can I sync my data across multiple devices?</h4>
                <p>Currently, Novo Recovery stores all data locally on your device to ensure maximum privacy. This means your data doesn't automatically sync across devices. We recommend using the app primarily on one device to maintain your recovery records.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What happens to my data if I uninstall the app?</h4>
                <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device, uninstalling Novo Recovery will permanently delete all your data. Before uninstalling, we recommend taking screenshots or backing up any important information you want to keep.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How do I backup my data?</h4>
                <p>Since data is stored locally, the best way to backup your information is through your device's standard backup process (iCloud or iTunes backup). Additionally, you can take screenshots of important entries or manually export data you want to preserve.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How do I upgrade to the lifetime version?</h4>
                <p>You can upgrade to the lifetime version directly within the app. Look for the "Upgrade" or "Premium" option in the app settings or menu. All purchases are processed securely through Apple's App Store. Please note that prices are subject to change and may increase at any time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>I purchased the app but it's not unlocking the premium features. What should I do?</h4>
                <p>First, try closing and reopening the app. If that doesn't work, go to your device's Settings > [Your Name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, and check your purchase history. If you still have issues, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kumkwat_splata.9n@icloud.com" style="color: #667eea;">kumkwat_splata.9n@icloud.com</a> with your purchase receipt.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How do I restore my purchase on a new device?</h4>
                <p>If you've purchased the lifetime version, you can restore your purchase on a new device. Look for the "Restore Purchase" option in the app settings. Make sure you're signed in with the same Apple ID you used for the original purchase.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Can I get a refund?</h4>

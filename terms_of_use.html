            <h3>20. Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>

            <h3>21. Waiver</h3>
            <p>No waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition. Any failure to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

            <h3>22. Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Novo Recovery regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter herein.</p>

            <h3>24. Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, natural disasters, labor disputes, or internet service failures.</p>
